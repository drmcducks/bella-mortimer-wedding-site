        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p class="ourstory">We had been friends since we were in diapers, when our mothers met at a playgroup and became best friends, we grew up together.
        We realized we had feelings for each other in our freshmen year, when we went on a school trip to Washington D.C. There, we cuddled for the first time
        and after that we decided to give our relationship a chance, and became lovers... 7 years later and here we are ready to step on another new adventure
        together... Marriage.. We believe that this unknown journey will be worth it as long as we're together.
